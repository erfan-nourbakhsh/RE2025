# 🧭 Feature Request Completeness Guide

A lightweight, practical taxonomy and checklist to **identify missing information** in feature requests before they reach engineering and design. Use this README as your repo’s front page to align product, design, and engineering on what “complete enough” looks like.

## Why this exists

Incomplete feature requests slow teams down, create back-and-forth, and introduce avoidable risk late in delivery.  
This guide provides a **shared vocabulary** and **ready-to-use templates** to spot and fill gaps early.

---

## How to use

1. **Adopt the taxonomy** below as your team’s shared language for “what’s missing.”
2. **Add the checklist** to your issue templates (GitHub, Jira, Linear, Notion, etc.).
3. **Use the JSON structure** to integrate with linters/bots that flag missing fields.
4. **Measure**: Track which categories are commonly incomplete and focus on improving upstream inputs.

## The Taxonomy (Definitions)

Each category below describes a common class of **incomplete information** found in feature requests, plus examples to make it concrete.

### 1) UI/UX Components
> Missing design details about how the feature appears or behaves in the interface.

- Examples:  
  - “Details on how the setting should be presented in the UI.”  
  - Missing wireframes, states, empty/error/loading behaviors, accessibility notes.

---

### 2) Justification
> Missing rationale about the **goal, intent, and requirements** coming from the requester.

- Examples:  
  - Why this feature matters now; what outcome it targets; how we’ll know it worked.

---

### 3) Goal
> Missing a clear purpose or objective for the request.

- Examples:  
  - “Clear purpose or goal of the feature request” not stated.

---

### 4) Behavior
> Missing decisions about **how the feature should work** under different scenarios.

- Examples:  
  - “Should this setting apply globally or be configurable per conversation?”  
  - “Show sent time for all messages or only some types?”  
  - “Specific behavior expected for the emoji feature?”

---

### 5) End User
> Missing clarity on **who** is impacted or benefits.

- Examples:  
  - “Target audience or users who will benefit.”  
  - “Intended user group.”

---

### 6) Time Constraints
> Missing project management context: **priority, urgency, timeline**.

- Examples:  
  - “Priority of the request,” “deadline/timeline for implementation,” “importance.”

---

### 7) Implementation
> Missing technical direction or constraints relevant to building the feature.

- Examples:  
  - Architecture notes, APIs affected, data models, telemetry, rollout plan.

---

### 8) Dependency
> Missing details on **requirements, constraints, and related artifacts** the feature relies on.

- Examples:  
  - “Specific platform/environment where the feature should be implemented.”  
  - “Any dependencies or related features to consider.”  
  - “How is out-of-country determined (e.g., phone country code, cell-tower registry)?”  
  - “Method of sharing (e.g., email, social media).”

---

### 9) Configuration
> Missing details about **settings** or **operational parameters** of the feature.

- Examples:  
  - “Automatic change to SMS fallback, or an additional sub-setting?”  
  - “What should the link point to (store page? friend-association)?”  
  - “Customization for the invite message?”  
  - “Does this apply to incoming MMS, outgoing MMS, or both? Separate settings?”

---

### 10) Security
> Missing information on **privacy, safety, permissions, and access**.

- Examples:  
  - “User permissions required to change this setting.”  
  - “Security and privacy considerations.”

---

### 11) Data Transmission
> Missing details on **how data flows** through the system.

- Examples:  
  - “Should messages be screened by the server before transmitting to the user?”

---

### 12) Testing
> Missing clarity on **impacts, verification, and analytics**.

- Examples:  
  - “Potential impacts on existing messaging system.”  
  - “How the change affects existing functionalities or dependencies.”  
  - “Potential compatibility issues.”  
  - “Analytics or tracking requirements for usage.”

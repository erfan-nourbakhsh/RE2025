Definitions 

UI/UX components: The incomplete information relates to design (UI/UX) information that is missing from the feature request. For example: “details on how the setting should be presented in the user interface”.  

Justification: The incomplete information relates to information associated with goal, intent, and other requirements for the feature request which comes mostly from the requester.  

Goal: Incomplete information that relates to missing goal of the feature request. For example: “clear purpose or goal of the feature request”. 

 Behavior: Incomplete information that relates to decision points for the feature requests that the request makes. For example: “information on whether this setting should be applied globally or be configurable per conversation”, “clarification on whether the sent time should be displayed for all messages or only for certain types of messages”, and “specific functionality or behavior expected with emoji feature”. 

End User: Incomplete information that relates to the target audience who this feature integration will impact. For examples: “target audience or users who will benefit from this feature”, and “intended user group”. 

Time constraints: Incomplete information that relates to information related to project management: priority, importance, and timeline. For example: “priority of the request”, “deadline or timeline for implementation”, and “priority or importance of the feature request”. 

Implementation: The incomplete information that discusses the implementation details missing from the feature request.  

Dependency: Incomplete information that relates to missing details on dependency of code to multiple software artifacts (for example: requirements, constraints, and more). For example: “Specific platform or environment where the feature should be implemented”, “Any dependencies or related features that should be considered”, “what method is being used to determine when a contact is out-of-country (e.g. country code on phone number, current cell tower visitor registry location)?”, and “method of sharing (e.g. email, social media)” 

Configuration: Incomplete information that relates to specific behavior that the feature needs to accomplish or setting/configuration for operation. For example: “Should this be an automatic change to how SMS fallback is enacted, or an additional sub-setting of SMS fallback?”, “What should the link itself do or point to? Simply the app's store page? Should it automatically associate the new user as a friend of the link provider?”, and “Extent of customization for the invite message.”, “Does this apply to incoming MMS, outgoing MMS, or both? Should each have a different setting?” 
 

Security: Incomplete information that relates to security, privacy, safety, permission, and access. For example: “specification on user permissions needed to change this setting”, and “Security and privacy considerations.”. 

Data Transmission: Incomplete information that relates to data flow within the software. For example: “How should this limitation be implemented? For example, should messages be screen by the server before transmitting them to the user?” 
 

Testing: Incomplete information that relates to potential impact when the feature is implemented. This could cover impacts for unit to integration testing and answer how the addition would affect other components of the existing system. For example: “Potential impacts on existing system for sending and receiving messages”, “Details on how this change might affect existing functionalities or any dependencies”, “potential impact on existing features or compatibility issues”, and “Analytics or tracking requirements for feature usage.”.  
 

Data/Storage: Incomplete information that relates to data and storage information. For example: “What size values should be provided?”, “Details about the desired maximum size limit for MMS”, and “Expected range or limits for the MMS size change”.
